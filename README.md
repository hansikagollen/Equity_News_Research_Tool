# 📊 Equity News Research Assistant

A **real-time document and news research platform** that enables semantic search and analysis over
PDFs, CSV datasets, text files, and live news articles using **vector search**.

The application is designed for **financial research, data exploration, and news analysis**, and demonstrates how modern retrieval systems used in LLM pipelines are built in practice.

---

---

## 🚀 What This Project Does

- Ingests **PDF, CSV, TXT files**, and **live news URLs**
- Converts documents into **semantic embeddings**
- Indexes data using **FAISS vector search**
- Allows users to **ask natural language questions**
- Displays **real-time ingestion progress** via WebSockets
- Provides fast, accurate **semantic search results**

---

## 🧠 Why This Project Matters

Analyzing large datasets and financial news manually is slow and inefficient.
This project shows how **vector databases and semantic search** can be used to build scalable,
real-time research tools similar to those used in modern AI-powered products.
